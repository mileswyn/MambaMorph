# Mamba-based deformable medical image registration with an annotated brain MR-CT dataset

## Abstract
Deformable registration is essential in medical image analysis, especially for handling various multi- and mono-modal registration tasks in neuroimaging. Existing studies lack exploration of brain MR-CT registration, and face challenges in both accuracy and efficiency improvements of learning-based methods. To enlarge the practice of multi-modal registration in brain, we present SR-Reg, a new benchmark dataset comprising 180 volumetric paired MR-CT images and annotated anatomical regions. Building on this foundation, we introduce MambaMorph, a novel deformable registration network based on an efficient state space model Mamba for global feature learning, with a fine-grained feature extractor for low-level embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaMorph surpasses advanced ConvNet-based and Transformer-based networks across several multi- and mono-modal tasks, showcasing impressive enhancements of efficacy and efficiency.
